# RSS-AI-RAG-Automation---n8n-Workflow

# Overview
This n8n workflow automates the process of curating and analyzing content from RSS feeds with the aim of filtering and classifying information related to AI risk topics. It uses a combination of automation pipelines and AI-powered analysis to parse incoming RSS data, assess risk relevance, and organize content for downstream processing or alerting.

# Key Features
* RSS Feed Integration: Automatically fetches and processes multiple RSS feeds to gather the latest content on AI-related topics.

* Content Parsing and Filtering: Uses custom code to identify and assess risk factors in the gathered content using relevant key words.

* Classification and Summarization: Summarizes large volumes of text and classifies them into relevant categories using generative AI.

* Workflow Automation: Integrates REST APIs, HTTP requests, and custom JavaScript nodes to orchestrate processing with no-code/low-code design.

* Scalable and Adaptable: Designed for flexible configurations to add/remove feeds, update classification rules, or extend AI model integrations.

* Multi-Agent Tool Integration: Leverages multi-agent orchestration for adaptive problem solving and dynamic content curation.

# How It Works
* Trigger and Fetch: The workflow starts by polling configured RSS feeds to fetch new content items.

* Filtering and Classification: Filters out low-risk or irrelevant content, classifies key information, and summarizes text for quick insight.

* Output and Notification: Outputs results to chosen destination.

# Technologies and Tools
* n8n for workflow automation

* AI models for text classification and summarization

* RSS feed monitoring and integration

* REST API and HTTP requests for external tool connections

* Custom JavaScript function nodes for advanced logic

* Multi-agent orchestration methods for dynamic problem solving

# Usage and Customization
* This workflow is ideal for researchers, analysts, or organizations monitoring AI safety and risk-related content from various sources. It provides a robust framework to streamline information retrieval and focus attention on the most critical insights.

* Customization points include:

* Adding or updating RSS feeds

* Adjusting AI classification model parameters

* Extending output integrations

* Tailoring filtering thresholds

# Security and Privacy
Sensitive endpoints and credentials are expected to be configured securely by the user. The shared workflow does not include sensitive keys or proprietary AI models for security reasons.
